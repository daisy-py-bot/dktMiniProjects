# Conversion Calculator: Sets, Boolean Logic, and Propositional Logic

The Conversion Calculator is a web-based application that facilitates conversions between sets, boolean logic expressions, and propositional logic expressions. It allows users to input expressions in one format and obtain the equivalent expressions in other formats, providing a versatile tool for users studying discrete structures or related topics.

## Features

Conversion Between Formats: The calculator supports conversion between sets, boolean logic expressions, and propositional logic expressions.
Input Flexibility: Users can input expressions using standard symbols and operators for each format.
Immediate Results: The calculator provides immediate results upon inputting or converting expressions.
Memory Function: Users can store and recall previous expressions, enhancing usability and convenience.
Clear and Intuitive Interface: The user interface is designed to be clear, intuitive, and easy to use.
Integration with VSCode Live Server: The calculator requires the user to have the Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code to view and interact with the application.
Supported Formats and Conversions

## Set Theory
Symbols: ∅ (Empty Set), U (Universal Set), ∪ (Union), ∩ (Intersection)
Conversion to/from Boolean Logic and Propositional Logic: Variables are mapped to set elements, and set operations correspond to logical operations.


## Boolean Logic
Symbols: 0 (Zero), 1 (Unit), + (Disjunction), '' (Conjunction)
Conversion to/from Set Theory and Propositional Logic: Variables are mapped to boolean variables, and logical operations correspond to set operations.


## Propositional Logic
Symbols: T (Tautology), F (Contradiction), ∧ (Conjunction), ∨ (Disjunction)
Conversion to/from Set Theory and Boolean Logic: Variables are mapped to propositions, and logical operations correspond to set operations.


## Usage

Install Live Server Extension: Ensure you have the Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
Open HTML File: Open the index.html file of the Conversion Calculator project in Visual Studio Code.
Start Live Server: Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" to start the server.
Interact with Calculator: Once the server is running, you can interact with the Conversion Calculator by entering expressions and performing conversions as needed.


## Technologies Used

The Conversion Calculator is developed using the following technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the user interface.
CSS: Styles the elements for a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: Implements the calculator's logic for input processing and conversions.
